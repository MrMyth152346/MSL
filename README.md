MSL (Myth's Scripting Language) is a very basic scripting language that I wrote.

Currently minus (-) operator is broken. So any math done in MSL that contains "*, /, -"  all in one might not give the correct result cause of the parser.
There isn't any garbage collection but I'm planning to work on one.
